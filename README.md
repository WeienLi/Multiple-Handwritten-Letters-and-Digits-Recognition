# Multiple-Handwritten-Letters-and-Digits-Recognition
Using deep learning techniques to recognize image containing multiple handwritten letters and digit. Dataset can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/comp-551-fall-2021/data. I was in Team 88, 19th out of 90 teams participated. This is achieved using a CNN deep learning technique. An semantic segmentation algorithm was developed but was never used due to lack of time all work are within the notebook.
